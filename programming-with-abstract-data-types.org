** Mathematics is used to build "models" of ADT called algebras
** Logic is used to formally specify ADT and to prove properties about them
** Formal verification is better than writing tests
** ADT are used once a formal specification is developed.
** ADT methodological principles:
*** Abstraction, implementation details are avoided
*** Modularization, programming task is divided in small manageable pieces
** Proofs as programs
*** formula === data type
*** constructive proof of formula A === program of data type A

* Logic (chapter 3)
** syntax and semantics of many-sorted first-order predicate logic
