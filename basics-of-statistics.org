* Basics of Statistics

  1.- Descriptive vs Inferential:  Descriptive is about to summarize data, drawing conclusions about something with relative few data.

** Data and visualization

*** Cases, variables and levels of measurement
 | type      | definition                   | examples                    |
 |-----------+------------------------------+-----------------------------|
 | cases     | subject                      | individual football players |
 | variables | characteristics of a subject | age, total number of goals  |
 |-----------+------------------------------+-----------------------------|

 Levels of measurement
 |                         |          | Difference | Order | Similar Intervals | meaningful zero point | example                           |
 |-------------------------+----------+------------+-------+-------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------|
 |                         | nominal  | √          | X     | X                 | X                     | nationality, gender               |
 | categorical             | ordinal  | √          | √     | X                 | X                     | order in football competition     |
 |-------------------------+----------+------------+-------+-------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------|
 | quantitative            | interval | √          | √     | √                 | X                     | age "differs" - similar intervals |
 | (discrete - continuous) | ratio    | √          | √     | √                 | √                     | body height                       |
 |-------------------------+----------+------------+-------+-------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------|

*** Data matrix and frequency table

    - Data matrix  is an  overview of cases and variables.   You don't
      present  a data  matrix to  others, you  rather use  a frequency
      table.
      | Data matrix | Age | Weight | Goals scored | Hair color |
      |-------------+-----+--------+--------------+------------|
      | Player 1    |  39 |   76.9 |            3 | brown      |
      | ...         |     |        |              |            |

    - Frequency table shows how the values are distributed over the
      cases.  This basically summarize the data matrix
      | Hair color (nominal) | Frequency | Percentage |
      |----------------------+-----------+------------|
      | blond                |        76 | 30%        |
      | brown                |       154 | 70%        |
      |----------------------+-----------+------------|
      | Total                |       230 | 100%       |

      Weight is a quantitative (ratio)  variable that is recoded into an
      ordinal variable
      | Weight (ratio -> ordinal) | Frequency | Percentage |
      |---------------------------+-----------+------------|
      | less than 60              |        76 |        30% |
      | 60 - 69.9                 |       154 |        70% |
      |---------------------------+-----------+------------|
      | Total                     |       230 |       100% |


*** Graphs and shapes of distributions
    - Graphs for categorical variables
      - Pie chart  is good  when you have  less categories.   Good for
        percentages.
      - Bar graph is good when you have high number of categories.
    - Graphs for quantitative variables
      - Dot plot useful when you have a couple of observations.
      - Histogram, bars touch each other.
    - Shapes of distributions (unimodal, bimodal)
      - bell shaped
      - skewed to the right (annual income football players)
      - skewed to the left
      - two peaks
