*** What's logic
    Logic studies the laws governing valid inference.

*** Examples
    | Concrete                   | Formal language           | Logic            |
    |----------------------------+---------------------------+------------------|
    | Helen is a woman           | woman(helen)              | P(x)             |
    | All woman are mortal       | ∀x. woman(x) => mortal(x) | ∀x. P(x) => Q(x) |
    |----------------------------+---------------------------+------------------|
    | Therefore, Helen is mortal | mortal(helen)             | Q(x)             |
    Are we allowed to conclude this?  P and Q are predicates.

*** What determine the meaning of proposition? by Martin Löf
    The meaning of a proposition is determined by what counts as a verification of it.
    ~A and B true~:
    - A is a proposition,
    - B is a proposition,
    - A and B is a proposition,
    - A and B true is a judgment.

*** Notes
    - An introduction rule is a definition.
    - When you use elimination those are things you can conclude.
    - Local soundness:
      - The elimination rules don't introduce nothing new. They can by
        justified because I already have evidence(D proof) of A.
    - Local reduction: I assembled evidence for the conclusion from
      somewhere else that I already have.
    - Local completeness:
      - You first need to have a proof D of ~A and B~
      - Then you can copy that proof as many times you want to use
        when applying the elimination rules.
      - Once you have all the pieces of information you need, the
        introduction rules should be used to get ~A and B~.
    - Local expansion: start with a small proof and ended up with one
      that is bigger.
    - The introduction rules and elimination rules are in ~Harmony~

*** Terminolgy
    - Premise
      - A premise is an assumption that something is true (you have evidence that something is true)
    - Inference
      - The process of deriving the strict logical consequences of assumed premises.
    - Inference rules
      - An Inference rule is a function that takes premises as input and returns a conclusion
    - Propositions?
    - Judgment?
