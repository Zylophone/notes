* On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws
** First Lecture
   - Logical Operators operate on *propositions* and *propositional functions*
   - Logical Laws -- ~rules of inference~ -- operate on *assertions/judgements*
   - Here ~A~, ~B~, and ~A & B~ are *affirmations* not *propositions*.
     Therefore, the affirmation of ~A~ and the affirmation of ~B~ takes us
     to the affirmation of ~A & B~.
