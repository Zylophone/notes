* On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws
** First Lecture
   - Logical Operators operate on *propositions* and *propositional functions*
   - Logical Laws -- ~rules of inference~ -- operate on *assertions/judgements*
\[
\hat{F}(\nu) = \frac{G(\nu)}{H(\nu)}.
\]
** Second Lecture
** Third Lecture
* Concepts
  - Assertions / Judgements
  - Propositions
  - Premises
  - Inference Rules
  - Logical Inference
  - Logical Operators
  - Enunciation vs Propositions
