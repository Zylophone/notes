* LFE is a language with lisp syntax to solve highly concurrent problems
* TODO It's not clear the difference between DATA MODE and CODE MODE
  - https://lfe.gitbooks.io/casting-spels/content/book/part1/2-synsem.html
  - It might be a good idea to just define a function maybe?
* DONE Tuple notation is weird
  #('name 'milton) --> (tuple 'name 'milton)
* TODO part 4: 1-records LFE creates several functions dynamically
  - Does it matter whether they are created dinamically?  "helper functions"??
* TODO Thinking in Patterns
  - Can the explanation about patterns be more clear?
  - What about baby steps?
    - First without patterns
    - Then we can use patterns to destructure
* TODO weird way to use guards
