* gen_fsm OTP behavior
  - states
  - global events
  - is it possible to combine this solution by having a gen_server and
    a gen_fsm?
  - Use a gen_server  when you want a long lived  process which reacts
    to  events.   Use a  gen_fsm  to  implement state  machines.   See
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine
